# BellChaser

Simple game prototype, players that have a bell can "tag/capture" other players.

Controls `WASD` movement and hold `right-click` for looking.

## Ideas:
#### Standard Gamemode: 
* Chasers can tag other players, once all players have been tagged chasers win.

#### Capture Gamemode: 
* Chasers can capture other players and lock them up.

#### Classes:
* Players can choose different classes, which can give advantages and disadvantes is certain scenarios.

#### Parkour: 
* Players can leap up to ledges, some parts may only be reached by certain players.

#### Dynamic Worlds: 
* Worlds can have dynamic interactables such as doors, elevators, draw bridges and more but some may be one-way or exclusive to certain teams and classes.
